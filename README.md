# 🎤 Karaoke App 🎶
An app to sing karaoke with your own library in a fun and innovative way!

## 🎯 Main Objective
The primary purpose of the app is to revolutionize karaoke singing for the vocalist. 🎵

This magical experience is achieved by playing the original song for the singer 🎧 through the headphones while the audience gets to hear only the instrumental 🎼 via the speakers.

## 🛠 How to set up
Inside the directory, you'll find a file named `.env`. You'll need to update the path pointing to where your song files are located.

🔧 The variable that needs an update is **DATA_PATH**.

## 📁 How to set up files
In the designated folder, ensure you have a file for every song 🎵 in JSON format with the following structure:

```json
{
    "title": "God's Plan",
    "artist": "Drake",
    "songpath": "C:\\Users\\grmap\\Music\\Karaoke\\Drake - God's Plan\\song.wav",
    "karaokepath": "C:\\Users\\grmap\\Music\\Karaoke\\Drake - God's Plan\\instrumental.wav",
    "lyricspath": "C:\\Users\\grmap\\Music\\Karaoke\\Drake - God's Plan\\lyrics.lrc"
}
```

Now, get ready to rock the stage and sing your heart out! 🌟🎤🕺💃
